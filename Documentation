Purpose:
The Quiz Question Bank is designed to store the questions for quizes, exams in a files and at the same time having a full control over it: editing, deleting, testing, etc.

Design Decisions:
1) Modular Design: The codebase is divided into functions and modules to enhance readability and maintainability.
2) Visual Representation: A visual part of this code is really bad, but in the future updates it can be changed.
3) Input Validation: Input validation is implemented to ensure that users provide valid syntaxes and operations.

Algorithms used: 
Classes and Objects: The QuestionBank class encapsulates the functionality related to managing a bank of quiz questions. It includes methods for adding, editing, deleting, displaying, and taking quizzes.

Data Structures Employed: 
The code employs the vector data structure from the Standard Template Library (STL) to store multiple instances of the Question struct.

Functions/Modules created:
1) addQuestion() : Used to add questions into the vector
2) editQuestion() : Used to edit any question by their index
3) deleteQuestion() : Used to delete any question by their index
4) displayQuestions() : Used to display/printout all the questions in a bank
5) takeQuiz() : Used to take a quiz with added questions
